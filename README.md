The behavior of the program should look like this:

The calculator should be able to calculate the count of periods, monthly payment and credit principal.
Then you need to ask them to input the remaining values.
Finally, compute and output the value that they wanted.
The calculation of differentiated payment. To do this, the user may run the program specifying interest, count of periods and credit principal.
a capacity to calculate the same values as in the previous stage for annuity payment (principal, count of periods and value of the payment). A user specifies all known parameters with command-line arguments, while a single parameter will be unknown. This is the value the user wants to calculate.
handling of invalid parameters. Showing error messages "Incorrect parameters" in case of invalid parammeters.
